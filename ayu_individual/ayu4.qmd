## Random Walks

#### Problem 1 (SRM Sample - Question 4)

You are given:

i) The random walk model 

$$
y_t =  y_0 + c_1 + c_2 + c_3 +...+c_t,
$$

where $c_i, (i = 1, 2,..., t)$ denote observations from a white noise process. 

ii) The following ten observed values of $c_t$: 

| t     | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 |10|
|:-------|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|:----|
| $y_t$ | 2  | 5  | 10  | 13  | 18  | 20  | 24  |25| 27  | 30  |


iii) $y_0 = 0$

#### Problem 2 (SRM Sample - Question 55)

You are given the following eight observations from a time series that follows a
random walk model:

| $y_t$ | 3  | 5  | 7  | 8  | 12  | 15  | 21  | 22  |


You plan to fit this model to the first five observations and then evaluate it against the
last three observations using one-step forecast residuals. The estimated mean of the white
noise process is 2.25.

Let F be the mean error (ME) of the three predicted observations.

Let G be the mean square error (MSE) of the three predicted observations.

## Autoregressive

#### Problem 3 

A stationary autoregressive model of order one can be written as

$$y_t = \beta_0 + \beta_1y_{t-1} + \epsilon, t =  1, 2,...$$

Determine which of the following statements about this model is false

(A) The parameter $\beta_0$ must not equal 1.
(B) If the parameter $\beta_1 = 0$, then the model reduces to a white noise process.
(C) If the parameter $\beta_1 = 1$, then the model is a random walk.


#### Problem 4 (SRM Sample - Question 64)

You are given a stationary AR(1) model, 

$$

$$

$$

| $t$   | 1   | 2   | 3   | 4   | 
|:------|:----|:----|:----|:----|
| $y_t$ | 1   | 3   | 5   | 8   |

Calculate $\hat{\beta}_0$ and $\hat{\beta}_1$ using the conditional least squares method.

#### Problem 6 (SRM Sample - Question 58)

#### Problem 10 (SRM Sample - Question 46)

A time series was observed at times 0, 1, â€¦, 100. The last four observations along
with estimates based on exponential and double exponential smoothing with $w =0.8$ are:

| Time ($t$)                  | 97   | 98   | 99   | 100   |
|:-----------------------------|:------|:------|:------|:-------|
| Observation ($y_t$)        | 96.9 | 98.1 | 99.0 | 100.2 |
| Estimates ($\hat{s}^(1)_t$) | 93.1 | 94.1 | 95.1 |       |
| Estimates ($\hat{s}^(2)_t$)                  | 88.9 | 89.9 |      |       |

All forecasts should be rounded to one decimal place and the trend should be rounded to
three decimal places.
